TinyPICO Explorer Shield Template
=================================

This is a template project for the Explorer shield that implements all of the hardware for TinyPICO, TinyS2 and TinyS3 and shows examples of everything working at a basic level.

This example project is still unfinished based on what  I'd like to have included, but it is a perfect spring board for getting an Explorer shield project up and running.

Please remember to install the following libraries from the Arduino Library Manager:

Adafruit_GFX

Adafruit_ST7789

Adafruit_LIS3DH

Adafruit_Sensor

Adafruit_MPR121
